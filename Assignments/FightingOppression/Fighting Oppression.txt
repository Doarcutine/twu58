    Although there is no evidence that women are less computer-conscious than men,the proportion of women employed by engineers remains far below men.In other words,most people still think women have poor computer skills.In the United States only 18% of computer science degrees are awarded to women,this is a surprising number.
    I don't think we should draw conclusions just by guessing,not only is there no evidence that women are weak in programming, but there is evidence that women are more efficient in programming in some ways.In the United States, for example,women represent 26% of the computing workforce and make up only 19% of software developers in the US.
    Iran is a country that focuses on equality between men and women,so 41% of Iranian CS graduates were female in 1999,and as of 2006, 70% of its science and engineering students are women,but the computer level of Iran is not obviously backward.There were many famous female programmers in history, and even the world's first computer programmer was a woman, so there's no reason to think that women are unsuitable for programming.
    I believe that with the continued development of the IT industry,female programmers will gradually be taken seriously, and the number of women in computer science and the IT industry will be significantly improved.
