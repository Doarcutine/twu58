  When I first heard about the company's employees at the presentation,what impressed me most was that the ratio of men to women in the company would be 1 to 1, which is a very special principle. It is also a manifestation of social and economic justice - equality between men and women.In addition,everyone has the same office environment,I think it's also a subtle expression of social and economic justice.
  The seminar also demonstrated the use of technology to solve problems for other countries,better humanity through software is not only the company's mission, but also an effort to achieve social and economic justice.
  These also made me aware of the value of social and economic justice,In the process of trying to achieve social and economic justice, people will be more mission oriented, so people will be more courageous and passionate, and strive to achieve this goal,this is a virtuous circle.It is not only the motive force of a person's struggle, but also the ideal goal of social development.
