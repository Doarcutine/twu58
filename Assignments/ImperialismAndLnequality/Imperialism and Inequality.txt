1.Gini Coefficient

  China's Gini coefficient in 2016 was 0.465,although at a high level,the overall trend is downward.When statistics are made on the Gini coefficients of countries around the world,Ukraine was 24.6% in 2013,Belarus was 26% in 2012,Kazakhstan was 26.4% in 2013,Sweden was 27.3% in 2012.Although there are countries with low Gene coefficients all over the world, the Gene coefficients in Europe's major developed countries are generally between 0.24-0.36.I think Sweden has a more equitable distribution of income,because the Swedish personal income tax system includes income from three types of income, namely, labor income, capital gains and operating income.In addition, about 70% of Sweden's taxes are used for social security,The low Gini coefficient in Sweden can also confirm that.

2.Learning About Imperialism

  Imperialism is really dangerous,When it comes to imperialism, we think of colonies, wars, monopolies,These words sound uncomfortable.Although monopoly is sometimes part of the national economy,such as state-owned enterprises, monopoly is often aggressive when it is associated with imperialism.
  I think India should be on the side of the Allies,although Britain's decision has led to the death of millions of people in India, most of the allies have fought for justice, and the atrocities of fascism have been obvious to all.Perhaps if India had been on the axis side, there would have been fewer casualties, but there might have been no India today.The alliance was the right one in the Second World War, and the choice of allies might not be the best choice, but it must be the right choice.

3.Recommendations for ThoughtWorks

  I recommend a documentary called the revolution OS.The documentary focuses on the history of Linux and helps to understand the open source culture.Which records the creation of Linux Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman, Bruce Perens, Eric Raymond, Brian Behlendorf, Michael Tiemann, Larry Augustin, Frank Hecker, Rob Malda's life experience or interview.
